# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

Install `sbtn` first from [here](https://github.com/sbt/sbtn-dist/releases/tag/v1.4.0-M2).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

run the ScalaTests from example module. Internally spins a test server.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
